## Project Proposal

### Overview

A app that allows users to plan a COVID-safe walk by providing information on a nearby trail, the weather, and restaurants/food trucks
with outdoor seating. 

### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

- Hiking Project API: https://www.hikingproject.com/data
- Yelp API: https://www.yelp.com/fusion
- Weather API: https://openweathermap.org/api

### Data

- User email, password
- User's general location via latitude/longitude 
    - Perhaps saved walked that they enjoyed 
- Ratings 
    - Reviews of how well the restaurants/food trucks are adhering to COVID safety precautions 
    - Reviews about a particular walk (easy/difficult; crowded/isolated)
- Maybe: user photos from the walks 

### Roadmap

#### MVP

- Users can generate a walking trail, get the weather, and see a couple restaurants nearby 
- Users can login
- Users can add a review about a walk / restaurant 

#### 2.0

- Users can add photos and comment on the other uploaded photos 

#### 3.0

- React
